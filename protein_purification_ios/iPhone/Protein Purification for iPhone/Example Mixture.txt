//The first non-comment line must contain the number of proteins in this mixture 
//and nothing else.

//
//The subsequent lines contain the data for each protein in the mixture.
//Each line must contain only comma-separated numbers with no white space or breaks.
//On each line the fields are as follows:
// Fields 1-7 contain the total numbers of ASP,GLU,HIS,LYS,ARG,TYR and CYS-SH
// residues respectively in the whole protein molecule (i.e aggregated over
// all polypeptide chains). These data are used to calculate the protein's charge
// at any pH value, and hence also to calculate the isoelectric point.
// Field 3 will be negative and less than -5 if a his tag is present.
// Field 8 contains the overall native molecular weight of the protein.
// Each protein can have up to three different polypeptide chains.
// Field 9 contains the number of polypeptides of type 1. This must always be greater than zero.
// Field 10 contains the number of polypeptides of type 2 if any or zero if not.
// Field 11 contains the number of polypeptides of type 3 if any or zero if not.
// Field 12 contains the molecular weight of polypeptide type 1. This cannot be zero.
// Field 13 contains the molecular weight of polypeptide type 2 
//   or zero if there is only one type of polypeptide.
// Field 14 contains the molecular weight of polypeptide type 3 
//   or zero if there is only one type of polypeptide.
// Field 15 contains the amount (in mg) of this protein in the initial mixture
// Field 16 contains the amount (in mg) of this protein in the mixture in its
//   current state.  This is to allow partially purified mixtures to be saved and
//   reloaded. When designing a mixture, set this field to the same value as field 15.
// Field 17 contains the temperature below which the enzyme activity is stable.
// Fields 18 and 19 contain the pH values between which the enzyme activity is stable
// Field 20 contains a number which sets the 'surface hydrophilicity'. This is
//   used to set the behaviour of the protein during ammonium sulfate fractionation
//   and hydrophobic interaction chromatography.
// Field 21 contains an integer which represents the initial specific enzymic activity
//   of the protein.
// Field 22 contains an in teger which represents the current specific activity.
//   This will normally be the same as the value of field 21.
//
// Comment lines must begin with //.
// Blank lines are not allowed.
// Be careful - there is almost no value/error checking done on these values.
// The usual disclaimers apply.
