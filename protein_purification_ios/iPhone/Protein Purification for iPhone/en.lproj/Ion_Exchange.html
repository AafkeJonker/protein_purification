<P>An ion-exchange resin consists of an insoluble matrix with charge groups covalently 
  attached. Both positively charged and negatively charged ion exchangers are 
  commercially available. Negatively charged exchangers bind positively charged 
  ions (cations). They can bind one type of cation but, when presented with a second 
  type of cation, this may displace, or exchange with, the first. Hence these 
  resins are called cation-exchange resins. Similarly anion-exchange resins are 
  positively charged and bind (and exchange) negatively charged ions (anions).</P>

<P>Several side-chain groups of the amino acid residues in proteins are ionizable 
  (e.g. lysine or glutamic acid) as are the N-terminal amino and C-terminal carboxyl 
  groups. Therefore proteins are charged molecules. This characteristic can be 
  used to separate different proteins by ion-exchange chromatography. The two 
  most commonly used resins for ion-exchange chromatography of proteins are carboxymethyl-cellulose 
  (CM-cellulose) and diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DEAE-cellulose). These are granular 
  celluloses which have been chemically modified. CM-cellulose is a resin where 
  the &#151;CH<SUB>2</SUB>OH groups of the carbohydrate have been converted to &#151;CH<SUB>2</SUB>OCH<SUB>2</SUB>COOH groups. At neutral pH this group is ionized 
  as &#151;CH<SUB>2</SUB>OCH<SUB>2</SUB>COO&#175; so that CM-cellulose is negatively 
  charged, i.e. it is a cation exchanger. DEAE-cellulose contains an ionizable 
  tertiary amine group instead. It is positively charged at neutral pH and so 
  DEAE-cellulose is an anion exchanger. Closely related to these ion-exchange 
  celluloses are DEAE-Sephadex and CM-Sephadex, containing the same ionizable 
  groups covalently attached to a Sephadex bead matrix, and the covalently cross-linked 
  agarose bead ion exchangers DEAE-Sepharose and CM-Sepharose. DEAE-cellulose 
  is now itself also available in a bead form called DEAE-Sephacel. The Sephadex 
  and Sepharose types are particularly useful for the separation of high molecular 
  weight proteins. In practice, since these matrices are very similar to those 
  used for gel filtration some molecular sieving may accompany the ion-exchange 
  process. This may either enhance or reduce the effectiveness of the fractionation 
  compared to using an ion-exchange cellulose. For simplicity in the computer 
  simulation, molecular sieving is assumed not to occur during ion-exchange chromatography. 
  Other ion-exchange resins using different ionizable groups from those described 
  here are also commercially available. This computer simulation includes the 
  following ion-exchange resins: CM-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose, Q-Sepharose Fast 
  Flow and S-Sepharose Fast Flow. The charged group of Q-Sepharose is a quarternary 
  amine which carries a non-titratable positive charge. Therefore this matrix 
  can be used at alkaline pH values at which the positive charge of the DEAE group 
  would have been titrated. The charged group of S-Sepharose is the sulphonyl 
  group (&#151;SO<SUB>3</SUB>&#175;).</P>
<P>The fractionation of proteins by ion-exchange chromatography depends upon differences 
  in the charge of different proteins. The charge of a protein depends upon the 
  number and type of ionizable amino acid side chain groups. Lysine residues, 
  for example, have a positively charged side chain group when ionized, whereas 
  glutamic acid residues are negatively charged when ionized. Each ionizable side 
  chain group has a distinct pK<sub>a</sub>; that is, the pH at which it is half dissociated. 
  Therefore the overall number of charges on a particular protein at a particular 
  pH will depend on the number and type of ionizable amino acid side chain groups 
  it contains. Since, by definition, different proteins have different amino acid 
  compositions, they will tend to have different charges at a given pH and so 
  can be fractionated on this basis.</P>
<P>For any one protein there will be a pH at which the overall number of negative 
  charges equals the number of positive charges and so it has no net charge. This 
  is its isoelectric point (pI), or more strictly speaking its isoionic point. 
  At this pH the protein will not bind to any ion-exchange resin. Below this pH 
  the protein will have a net positive charge and will bind to a cation exchanger, 
  whilst above this pH it will have a net negative charge and bind to an anion 
  exchanger. In principle, therefore, one could choose to use either a cation 
  exchanger or an anion exchanger to bind the protein of interest. However, proteins 
  are usually stable (and functionally active) only within a fairly narrow pH 
  range so that the choice of ion exchanger is often dictated by the pH stability 
  of the desired protein. If the protein is most stable at pH values below its 
  pI, a cation exchanger should be used whereas if it is most stable at pH values 
  above its pI, an anion exchanger would be chosen. Clearly, if it is stable over 
  a wide pH range, use of either type of resin can be attempted and that which 
  gives the best fractionation is selected.</P>
<P>When ion-exchange resins are purchased, the ions bound to the charged groups 
  on the resin are called 'counterions'. For CM-cellulose the counterion is usually 
  Na<SUP>+</SUP> and for DEAE-cellulose the counterion is normally Cl&#175;. After 
  choice of the appropriate resin, it is mixed with buffer to form a slurry which 
  is poured into a suitable chromatography column. The pH of this starting buffer 
  is crucial since it will determine the charge on the proteins to be separated. 
  The starting buffer pH should be at least one pH unit above or below the pI 
  of the protein to be bound to the resin to ensure adequate binding. However, 
  bear in mind that CM-cellulose and DEAE-cellulose are examples of weak ion exchangers. 
  A weak ion exchanger is one which is ionized over only a limited pH range. Thus 
  DEAE-cellulose begins to lose its charge above pH 9 whilst CM-cellulose begins 
  to lose its charge below about pH 5. The term 'weak' does not refer to the strength 
  of binding of ions to the resin nor to the physical strength of the resin itself. 
  With these points in mind then, the effective starting pH range when using DEAE-cellulose 
  or CM-cellulose is only about pH 5 - 9. In addition to correct choice of the 
  pH of the starting buffer, one should take care that its ionic strength is reasonably 
  low since the affinity of proteins for ion-exchange resins decreases as ionic 
  strength increases. Indeed this property is used in one method of eluting the 
  bound proteins (see below).</P>
<P>Once poured into the column, the bed of ion-exchange resin is washed well with 
  starting buffer and then the protein mixture is applied. Proteins which are 
  oppositely charged to the resin at the starting pH will bind to it, so displacing 
  the counterions. Proteins with the same charge as the resin or with no net charge 
  will not bind and so will flow straight through the column. The different proteins 
  bound to the column, one of which will be the protein of interest, will have 
  different affinities for the ion exchanger due to differences in their net charge. 
  These affinities can be altered by varying either the pH or the ionic strength 
  of the column buffer. Consider a set of proteins bound to the anion exchanger, 
  DEAE-cellulose. As the pH is lowered, &#151;COO&#175; groups on the protein begin to become 
  protonated and so lose their charge. Thus the overall negative charge of the 
  protein will decrease and therefore so will its affinity for the resin. Different 
  proteins will elute from the resin at different pH values as their number of 
  negative charges decreases to a critical value. Therefore one can resolve the 
  proteins bound to the column by slowly reducing the pH using a buffer pH gradient 
  and collecting fractions, each of which will contain different proteins eluted 
  at different pH values. Conversely, when using a cation exchanger, the pH gradient 
  would be arranged to increase to elute the bound proteins.</P>
<P>Instead of changing pH to elute proteins bound to an ion exchanger, one can 
  increase the ionic strength of the column buffer instead. At low ionic strength, 
  competition between the buffer ions and proteins for charged groups on the ion 
  exchanger is minimal and so the proteins bind strongly. However, once the proteins 
  are bound, increasing the ionic strength increases the competition and so reduces 
  the interaction between the ion exchanger and proteins, causing the proteins 
  to elute. One can elute the bound proteins by increasing ionic strength irrespective 
  of whether an anion or cation exchanger was used. This is usually accomplished 
  by incorporating a linear concentration gradient of NaCl in the column buffer 
  while keeping the pH constant.</P>
<P>Use of either a continuous pH gradient or a continuous salt (ionic strength) 
  gradient will result in a high degree of protein fractionation based on protein 
  charge. In practice one can also use stepwise elution, i.e. alter the pH or 
  ionic strength in discrete known steps. Although technically simpler to carry 
  out on occasions, stepwise gradients typically give poorer resolution than continuous 
  gradient elution and so are not modelled in this program.</P>
