# Protein Purification

Protein Purification is an award-winning program which has been widely used in schools, colleges and universities since 1983. It aims to guide you through a simulation of some of the more commonly-used protein separation techniques and to let you experiment with the simulation. It starts off by letting you examine how a simple mixture of proteins behaves during gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography and then goes on to allow the design and testing of full purification protocols using more complex mixtures of proteins.

It is assumed that you are familiar with the theoretical background to the most common separation techniques, enzyme assays etc. and that you understand the concept of the isoelectric point of proteins. The simulation models failure as accurately as success - so you need to be careful!

The author of this program, Prof. Andrew Booth, died on 6 June 2016.  This repository is provided as a memorial to his life and work.
