<P>You have been attached to a research laboratory and have been given the task of purifying one or more enzymes in as economical a way as possible.  You have been allocated all of the equipment and materials that you are likely to need.  You also have the services of a skilled but rather uncommunicative technician.  At the last minute your supervisor leaves on an extended sabbatical visit to a laboratory overseas.  In other words, you are on your own.  You must take all of the decisions and instruct your technician accordingly.  Good luck!</P>
