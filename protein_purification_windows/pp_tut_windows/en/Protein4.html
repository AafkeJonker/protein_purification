<H2>Exercise 4 of 6<BR>Purifying a protein - a sequential process</H2>
<hr width="100%" >By now you will have realised that you cannot purify protein 2 in a single step by gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography.  (The mixture was specially designed to contain two proteins with the same molecular weight and two with the same isoelectric point.) However, by using the two techniques sequentially, it should be possible to purify protein 2. This sequential use of techniques which make use of the different properties of a protein is a key feature of most purification schemes.
<P>Here is one way in which you could purify protein 2.<HR WIDTH=100%>

<BR>You will get the same elution profile as you did last time you used Sephadex G-100.  Last time, you identified which proteins were in the two peaks by using 2-dimensional electrophoresis.  This is somewhat unrealistic, since 2D gels are time-consuming to set up and run.  You certainly wouldn't use them as a routine system for monitoring fractions.  Protein 2 is an enzyme, so you can find out which fractions contain it by assaying them all for the enzymic activity.

<BR clear=left><br>Pool the fractions containing the enzymic activity.  Protein 3 should have been removed by the gel filtration step, leaving proteins 1 and 2 to be separated by the ion exchange chromatography. So your material should be pure. It is now worth examining it by 1D- and 2D- electrophoresis to check its purity.
